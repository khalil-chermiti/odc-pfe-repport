In response to the growing demand for proficient coders and problem solvers, Orange Digital Center initiated a project aimed at developing a platform to manage coding events and competitions. This platform serves as a centralized system for organizing and overseeing coding challenges, events, and competitions, with the goal of fostering skill development and community engagement among participants.. 
\bigskip
During our internship at Orange Digital Center, we were tasked with the development of this platform. The objective was to create a user-friendly interface that facilitates the management of coding events while providing participants with opportunities for collaboration and skill enhancement.\bigskip

This report provides an overview of the process involved in conceptualizing,
designing, and implementing the platform, from its inception to its practical
implementation. Through the integration of modern technology and a focus
on user needs, the platform aims to streamline the organization of coding events
and competitions, ultimately contributing to the cultivation of a vibrant 
coding community.\bigskip

By examining the various aspects of platform development and deployment,
this report seeks to shed light on the role of technology in supporting skill
development and fostering community engagement within the context of coding
events and competitions.
